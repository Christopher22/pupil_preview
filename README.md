# Pupil detection preview
A Pupil plugin allowing the export of frames during a running recording and therefore providing an instant preview of the pupil detection. On the extracted frames, the default-initialized 2D detector is applied for getting a rough overview about the detection quality. After the recording, a buildin viewer is able to visualize the gained previews.

## Installation
1. Drop the preview.py into the plugin directory
2. Activate both the Frame Publisher and the detection preview
3. (Start a recording - the frames are exported.)
